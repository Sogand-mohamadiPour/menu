# 🍕 Pizza Menu – Full-Stack Project

A full-stack pizza menu web app built with **React (frontend)** by me and **Django REST Framework (backend)** by my friend.  
The project lets users browse delicious pizzas and interact with a dynamic menu powered by real API data.

---

## 🚀 Overview
- **Frontend:** React + Fetch + useEffect  
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- **Data Flow:** The React app fetches pizza data from the DRF API  
- **Goal:** Build a simple and clean pizza menu with real-time backend connection  

---

## 🧩 Features
- 🍕 Dynamic pizza list fetched from API  
- 🔍 Interactive UI built with React hooks  
- ⚙️ Django REST backend providing structured JSON data  
- 🌐 Connected frontend and backend for a full-stack experience
